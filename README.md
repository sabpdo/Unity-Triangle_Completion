# Unity-Triangle_Completion

In my work with Dr. Chrastil's Spatial Navigation lab, I re-coded a spatial navigation task known as Triangle Completion into Unity using C#. I also 
used Blender to create some of the objects.

Triangle completion is a homing task that requires users to travel two legs of a triangle and return to their intial position. This requires users to angle themselves correctly 
and estimate the correct distance.
